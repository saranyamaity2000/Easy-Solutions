   observation : no of odd factors - 1; 
   HOW ? lets say 15
   15 has odd factors 1 , 3 , 5 , 15 ; 
   take 1 . only 15 , just number itself so not okay !

   take 3 , 15/3 = 5 , so 15 can be broken into 5 5 5 
   now this 5 5 5 can be transformed to 5-1 5 5+1 => 4 5 6 

   take 5 , 15/5 = 3 , so 15 can be broken as 3 3 3 3 3 3
   now this can be written as 3-2 3-1 3 3+1 3+2 => 1 2 3 4 5
 
   take 15, now thats a interesting case it is included not because
   it can be broken like others it is included by default 
   as a odd factor as 15 can be written as (15/2) (15/2)+1=> 7 8

   SO NOW YOU GOT THE OBSERVATION BUDDY ? ðŸ”¥
